 * This entry point should be called to get access to a list of activities for a given user
 *
 * GET Parameters:
 * REQUIRED:
 *   token_id: the token_id returned after the user_register call. the call will have to be authenticated
 *             with the paremeters used to register the token_id
 * OPTIONAL paging parameters:
 *   start: the offset from the latest activities to start the list from.
 *   limit: the maximum number of activities to return
 *   activity_id: the first activity_id to base the start of the list
 * OPTIONAL format parameters:
 *   activities_garmin_health: if set to 1, the output format will match the one of a backfill call from
 *                   the garmin health api for the API end point `activites`. This can be useful for testing.
 *   file_garmin_health: if set to 1, the output format will match the one of a backfill call from
 *                   the garmin health api for the API end point `file`. This can be useful for testing.
